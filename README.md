Creditworthiness Assessment Using ML Classification:

In this project, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and data cleaning using Pandas, followed by creating visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
My analysis revealed a higher default rate among applicants with loans, with defaulters exhibiting higher averages in loan amount, interest rate, debt-to-income ratio, open accounts, and credit utilization. 
I developed a Logistic Regression model to assess creditworthiness, achieving an impressive F1 score of 87% and a precision of 94%. 
Based on these findings, I recommended revising lending criteria and implementing more stringent checks for high-risk applicants to reduce default rates and improve overall portfolio health.
